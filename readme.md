Titleist Pro V1 by Jenny Hedley https://jennyhedley.github.io/

The hole is my goal
no better place to be
a whack and a smack
shit, look out for trees

threesomes and foursomes
I dare say not moresomes
gimmes and mulligans
your handicap is full of ‘em

I’m the bulge in your pocket
smeared mud on my pores
smell of white calfskin gloves
always gets me for sure

caress my dimples
you spit, I’ll shine 
I’m a Titleist, a winner
you don’t care a fuck ‘bout Title IX
tee me up, place your bets
Is your daddy paying or mine?

drip drop runs the sweat
sheen of sunscreen on legs
I see up your culottes
pom-pom socks all the rage

I’m a spinner, a flyer
runaway long drive
you can crack me 
and thrash me
betcha can’t make that par five

look out for the divot
the slope of green grass
on the backswing you pivot
I’m in the sand trap, jackass

birdies and eagles 
bogeys and binaries
clubhouse: KEEP OUT
MEN ONLY

no denim, no short shorts
third homes, fourth wives
one martini or two 
extra stiff, make it dirty
three olives in mine

ladies who lunch
gents whine and dine
crack a coldie, place your bets
privileged motherfuckers
got nothin’ better to do with your time
